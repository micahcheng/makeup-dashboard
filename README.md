# makeup-dashboard
This project showcases an interactive data visualization dashboard built with Panel, hvPlot, and Pandas to analyze beauty product data.

I developed an API class that automates the ETL pipeline:
Extract: Load product data from CSV.
Transform: Filter, clean, and aggregate information.
Load: Feed structured data into visualizations.

Dashboard Features
Sankey Diagram: Visualizes product flow from gender → skin type → category → brand.
Scatter Plots: Show relationships between price and ratings.
Bar Charts: Highlight top-rated brands and average prices by category.

Use Case
Designed as a decision-support tool for shoppers and analysts—helping users filter by skin type, compare products, and identify brand trends.
The ETL-style data handling and interactive analytics mirror the kind of tools and dashboards used in data and risk analysis for rapid trend detection and informed decision-making.

Tech Stack: Python · Panel · hvPlot · Pandas
